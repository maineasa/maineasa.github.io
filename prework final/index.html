			I'll be a student of the Per Scholas Software Engineering course this session, so here I am, doing this first assignment. From this program I hope to put myself on a path toward more fulfilling career prospects and better job stability than I've had so far. I've had some minor experience with programming in the past - as I took a few semesters of programming in high school - but I don't remember too much from them and none of them covered html or javascript. That's me off to the right, by the way, not just some random guy from google.

			Outside of an academic introduction, I'm into music, video games, and a bit of tabletop gaming as well. I played clarinet and piano through middle school, high school, and college (of which I attended a year and a half), and still occasionally play piano. I've gotten a bit rusty a both, though. I also like food, and enjoy eating painfully spicy pad thai. A friend of mine has eaten a whole Carolina Reaper twice, but I'm not that stupid when it comes to spice. I'll add a table listing foods, their spiciness, and my opinion of them on the M&M page.
