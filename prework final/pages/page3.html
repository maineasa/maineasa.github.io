		<h3>
			The Asa Maine Donation Campaign
		</h3>
		<p>For nearly 23 years, the Asa Maine Campaign has been bringing you on the go news and action, live from a relatively normal individual living in the contiguous United States. Unfortunately, that could all soon change. Depending on potentially unplanned financial stresses, the Asa Maine campaign could find itself in dire straits one day. The best time to plant a tree for tomorrow is today. We here at the Asa Maine Campaign encourage you to consider what it is that this campaign brings to your life, and how much that really means to you.</p>
		<p>
			During our last fundraising campaign, questions were raised about the validity of both our claims and the use of the funds. While everything resolved itself neatly in the end, we here at the Campaign would like to assauge those worries right from the get go. The Asa Maine Campaign is planning an eleven day, ten night excursion to Japan and South Korea (weather and global politics permitting), in order to ensure that the resources from this fundraising will not be there in the future. We plead that you consider again the impact this Campaign has on your life. Thank you.
