			Welcome to my second page! I'm not really even going to consider CSS'ing a video into this text, so you can look forward to a video down below. I'll reflect on my first page a bit, both to share my experience and reach the two paragraph word count. Overall, I'm satisfied with the color scheme. It's really just the primary colors and off white, but it doesn't look bad, which is what I was going for. I thought the menu on <a href="https://learnlayout.com/">learnlayout.com</a> was really cool, so I wanted to mess around with my navigation menu a bit. It works, the color changes when you hover over a link. Kinda neat. Also, click my face on the homepage.

			I guess I can fill this out with more information about me. Blue is the superior color, red color schemes are too aggressive. Green is an alright color, but it's something that has to have some color variation in it or around to really make it look good. Speaking of colors, I like movies, though I don't know I've watched a ton. Uncut Gems was a wild ride, I really liked Adam Sandler in it. I was pretty disappointed when COVID got released on store shelves, as I'd already bought my ticket for the new James Bond movie in April. Oh well. Anyway, below you'll find a couple fun things.
